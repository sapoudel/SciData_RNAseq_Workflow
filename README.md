# RNAseq_workflow
This pipeline will guide you through the analysis of RNAseq data, from FASTQ files to finding differentially expressed genes.

What you need:
1. [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
1. [Bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) or [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
1. FASTA and GFF/GB file for your organism
1. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html) with [R kernel](https://irkernel.github.io/)
